# Delucia Miner
Ultima Online EasyUO Miner for Delucia Mountain Range

The thing that got me into programming was watching my dad attempt to mine the [Delucia](https://uo.com/wiki/ultima-online-wiki/world/cities-and-towns/cities-and-towns-delucia/) mountains in [Ultima Online](https://uo.com/wiki/ultima-online-wiki/) using the [EasyUO](http://www.easyuo.com/) automation client. I had asked him at the time to teach me, and he threw a massive C++ book at me and told me to read that first. Needless to say, I did not pick up programming then. It wasn't until later when I went to college and took a programming course that I got into it. Now, after completing a Masters degree in software engineering, I wanted to return to the original project I had and complete it.

I had planned on doing something very over-the-top, like creating a tree parser so that I could get linting for my code, but that would easily draw this out to something from a weekend project to a several week or even months long one. I will use the tools that are available to me, such as git, issue trackers, etc.

## Goals

For this project, the main goal will be to create a working EasyUO script that can walk from one mining location to the next and mine for ore without manual intervention for at least two whole times through its pre-planned mining course. This may or may not be with a pack horse. I think it would be helpful for pack horsing the rare metals and using the ground to move around the iron ore. It should also be able to tinker new tools if necessary.

## Setup

As automating to this degree is generally not accepted, I am planning to create my own local RunUO server with vanilla pre-AOS settings (I can't narrow it down much further than that for patches unfortunately. I doubt bonded pets were a thing, but that is probably the only major thing that I may take advantage of that would not be present at the time).

I will also be using the most recent EasyUO version just so that I can use a more recent UO client. I am thinking 7.0.15.0 as that is generally my choice for pre-AOS (it still came out way after, but we are talking a 2007 client versus one from today).

I am not going to give myself any special skills beyond maybe enough tinkering so that I can make mining equipment and not fail too often. It would be nice to have some magery and decent mining skill, but those are definitely nice-to-have's.

In order for this to be able to loop through correctly, I am going to need roughly 30 or so mining locations in order for the ore to respawn, given that it is roughly going to take a minute to completely mine out a single area and locations respawn after 20-30 minutes on average.
